# Platformer-1
This is my first platformer experiment, it will be bad and buggy and might be abandoned because I will move onto a better project another time

I'm mainly using this to just keep a record of what I've done

update 0.0.1 - basic left right movement achieved

major update 0.1.0 - the game is somewhat functional with infinitely generating platforms, game is very scuffed and not working all the time. you may need to refresh to get a good generation at first, but yeah its epic swaggers
